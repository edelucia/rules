Adversaries may create or modify system-level processes to repeatedly execute malicious payloads as part of persistence. 
When operating systems boot up, they can start processes that perform background system functions. 
On Windows and Linux, these system processes are referred to as services. 
On macOS, launchd processes known as Launch Daemon and Launch Agent are run to finish system initialization and load user specific parameters.
