Adversaries may create or modify Windows services to repeatedly execute malicious payloads as part of persistence. 
When Windows boots up, it starts programs or applications called services that perform background system functions.
Windows service configuration information, including the file path to the service's executable or recovery programs/commands, is stored in the Windows Registry. 
Service configurations can be modified using utilities such as sc.exe and Reg.
